# Breadth-First Search

* The algorithm keeps visiting the nodes and then he neighbors of the nodes.
* `O(V + E)` running time complexity
* The memory complexity of this approach is not favorable as we have to store a lot of references
* Advantage is that we can construct the shortest path - essentially Dijkstra's algorithm does a `breadth-first search` if all edge weights are equal to
